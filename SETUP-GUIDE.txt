=================================================================

1. In your repository, click "Settings" (top menu)

3. Under "Source", select: GitHub Actions
   ⚠️ NOT "Deploy from a branch" - must be "GitHub Actions"

4. No need to save - it auto-saves

=================================================================
STEP 4: ENABLE WORKFLOW PERMISSIONS
=================================================================

1. Still in Settings, click "Actions" in left sidebar

2. Click "General" under Actions

=================================================================
STEP 6: ACCESS YOUR GAME
=================================================================

After you see the green checkmark:

1. Go to Settings → Pages

2. You should now see a blue box:
   "Your site is live at https://..."

3. Click that link OR go directly to:
   
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mountain-Man-Game/
   
   Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
   Example: https://johndoe123.github.io/Mountain-Man-Game/

4. Your game is now LIVE and accessible to anyone with the link!

=================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=================================================================

PROBLEM: "404 - There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"
------------------------------------------------------
CAUSE: Deployment hasn't finished or wrong URL

FIX:
1. Wait 5 full minutes after green checkmark
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check URL is exactly: https://USERNAME.github.io/Mountain-Man-Game/
4. Go to Settings → Pages and verify it says "Your site is live"

PROBLEM: Red X in Actions tab
------------------------------
CAUSE: Build failed

FIX:
1. Click on the red X workflow
2. Look for error message
3. Common errors:
   
   "Failed to resolve /src/main.jsx"
   → Your repo name doesn't match vite.config.js
   → Edit vite.config.js, change line 6 to match your repo name
   
   "npm ci failed"
   → package-lock.json missing
   → Edit .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   → Change line 28 from "npm install" to "npm ci"

PROBLEM: "This repository is private"
--------------------------------------
CAUSE: GitHub Pages requires public repos (unless you have a paid plan)

FIX:
1. Settings → General → scroll to bottom
2. Click "Change visibility" → "Make public"

PROBLEM: Workflow doesn't run at all
-------------------------------------
CAUSE: .github folder didn't upload (it's hidden)

FIX:
1. Show hidden files (see Step 2)
2. Delete all files in repository
3. Re-upload, making sure you see .github folder
4. OR create the file manually:
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   - Paste contents from deploy.yml in this package
   - Commit

PROBLEM: "No such file or directory: dist"
-------------------------------------------
CAUSE: Build didn't create dist folder

FIX:
1. Actions tab → Click failed workflow
2. Click "Build" step
3. Look for actual error message earlier in log
4. Usually means there's a syntax error in App.jsx

PROBLEM: Site loads but shows blank page
-----------------------------------------
CAUSE: Wrong base path in vite.config.js

FIX:
1. Edit vite.config.js
2. Line 6 should be: base: '/Mountain-Man-Game/'
3. Must match your repository name EXACTLY (including capitals)
4. Commit change
5. Workflow will auto-run and redeploy

=================================================================
MAKING UPDATES LATER
=================================================================

To change the game after it's deployed:

1. Edit src/App.jsx in your repository
2. Commit the changes
3. Workflow automatically runs and redeploys
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Refresh your game URL to see changes

=================================================================

=================================================================
STILL HAVING ISSUES?
=================================================================

If you've followed all steps and it's still not working:

1. Make sure repository is PUBLIC
2. Make sure Source is "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from branch")
3. Make sure Workflow permissions are "Read and write"
4. Make sure .github folder uploaded (check if you can see it)
5. Wait 5 full minutes after green checkmark before checking URL

Common mistakes:
❌ Repository is private
❌ Source set to "Deploy from branch" instead of "GitHub Actions"
❌ Workflow permissions still on "Read-only"
❌ .github folder didn't upload (hidden files not shown)
❌ Checking URL before deployment finishes
❌ Wrong URL format (missing trailing slash, wrong capitalization)

=================================================================
SUCCESS CHECKLIST
=================================================================

After following all steps, you should have:

✓ Repository named "Mountain-Man-Game" (public)
✓ All files uploaded (including .github folder)
✓ Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
✓ Settings → Actions → Permissions = "Read and write"
✓ Actions tab → Green checkmark on workflow
✓ Settings → Pages → Shows "Your site is live at..."
✓ Game loads at: https://USERNAME.github.io/Mountain-Man-Game/

If all checkmarks above are ✓, your game is LIVE!
